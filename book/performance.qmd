# Performance

As you've probably heard by now, [Polars is very very fast](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html).

Mention .profile

Show bread-and-butter messy data example
Show gcd
Show window functions (show how sorting speeds up)
List performance rules:
    - Be lazy
    - Use expressions
    - Smallest ints required
    - Use efficient storage (if you're storing stuff in files, Parquet is a good choice)
    - Use categoricals for recurring strings
    - Only use the columns you need

tell them that the Modern Polars book says they're dumb and they should feel bad.
